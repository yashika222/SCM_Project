   <p><font size="20" >Indian culture</font> is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse India. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from place to place within the country.<br>

    Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has been influenced by a history that is several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley civilization and other early cultural areas.Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India, and the world According to Jean Przyluski, there is evidence for regional influence from Austroasiatic (Mon Khmer) groups on certain cultural and political elements of Ancient India, which may have arrived together with the spread of rice cultivation from Mainland Southeast Asia. An ethnic minority in Eastern India is still speaking Austroasiatic languages, most notably the Munda languages. The British Raj further influenced Indian culture, such as through the widespread introduction of the English language,and a local dialect developed.</p><br>

       <tr><th>Cultural development is a historical process. Our ancestors learnt many things from their
            predecessors. With the passage of time they also added to it from their own experience and gave up
            those which they did not consider useful. We in turn have learnt many things from our ancestors. As
            time goes we continue to add new thoughts, new ideas to those already existent and sometimes we
            give up some which we don’t consider useful any more. This is how culture is transmitted and
            carried forward from generation to next generation. The culture we inherit from our predecessors is
            called our cultural heritage.</th>

    <td>India is a country with a diverse culture. India’s culture refers to a group of small distinct civilizations. Clothing, festivals, languages, religions, music, dance, architecture, food, and art are all part of Indian culture. Most notably, various foreign civilizations have affected Indian culture throughout its history. Furthermore, the history of Indian culture spans millennia. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism are all religions. These religions are all founded on karma and dharma. These four are also known as Indian faiths. Along with Abrahamic religions, Indian religions constitute a major group of world religions.</td>

<font size="50"><i>india</i></font> is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since Independence. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.
